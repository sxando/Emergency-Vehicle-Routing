    Returns:

            The first returned value is always:

                           expansions (if return_visited=True).

    Optimization Notes:
        - Includes a heuristic-based tie-breaking method: prioritizing nodes 
          with lower heuristic values (closer to the goal) when nodes have 
          identical f(n) values.
        - This tie-breaking reduces unnecessary expansions in grids with uniform 
          movement costs and identical values.

    Complexity:
        - Best-case: O(N logN)
        - Average-case: O(N logN) -> Improved 
                        (Previous: O(N logN) < O(Avg case) < O(N^2 logN))

****************************************** [ Note ] *******************************************

1. Priority Queue Ordering and Tie-breaking:
Nodes are prioritized based on their estimated total cost f(n) = g(n) + h(n). 
When nodes have identical f(n) values, tie-breaking is performed using 
the heuristic value h(n), preferring nodes closer to the goal. 
This reduces unnecessary node expansions significantly.

2. Data Structures:
- openSet: Implemented as a min-heap priority queue, 
           extracting the minimal priority element in O(log N) time.
- closedSet: Tracks already expanded nodes, ensuring each node is expanded 
             at most once, for computational efficiency.

Complexity:
Best-case: O(N logN)
Average-case (tie-breaking heuristic): Improved to O(N logN)
Worst-case: O(N^2 logN)
