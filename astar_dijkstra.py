                           expansions (if return_visited=True).

    Optimization Notes:
        - Use a min-heap (priority queue) and a heuristic-based tie-breaking 
          method: prioritizing nodes with lower heuristic values (closer to 
          the goal) when nodes have identical f(n) values.
        - This tie-breaking reduces unnecessary expansions in grids with uniform 
          movement costs and identical values.
        - The parent-pointer method allows efficient O(N) memory use,
          rebuilding the full path only once after the search.

    Complexity:
        - Best-case: O(N logN)
        - Average-case: =< O(N^2 logN)
        - Worst-case: O(N^2 logN)

        - g: The actual cost from the start node to the current node along the path.
        - h: The heuristic estimate from the current node to the goal.
            - For A*, this is the Manhattan distance (L1 norm) between the node

            - For A*, this is the node's evaluation value in the priority queue.

    Generate a random map with a valid path from start to goal.

    - Tries up to max_attempts times to produce a map where a valid path exists.
    - Uses A* to check for solvability.
    - If no path is found after all attempts, raises an error.

    Parameters:
        prob_block: float
                    Probability that a given cell is an obstacle.
        start: tuple
               (row, col) position for the start node.

        max_attempts: int, optional
                      Maximum number of attempts to generate a solvable map.

    Returns:
        grid: np.ndarray
              2D grid with 0=open, 1=obstacle.
        path: list of tuple
              The shortest path from start to goal, if found.
        costs: dict
               Expanded cells and their (g, h, f) values.

def main():
    """
    Runs a series of pathfinding experiments comparing the A* algorithm and 
    Dijkstra’s algorithm on random N x N grid maps with varying obstacle 
    densities.

    For each specified obstacle probability case:
      - Generates a random, solvable grid map ensuring start and goal cells are 
        open and not dead-ended.
      - Runs both the A* and Dijkstra algorithms to solve the shortest path 
        problem from start to goal.
      - Collects and logs detailed statistics, expansion order, 
        and path information for each algorithm.
      - Visualizes the grid, expanded nodes, path, and per-node cost values.
      - Saves all results, statistics, and visualizations for later analysis.

    Workflow:
      1. Defines test cases as a set of obstacle probabilities (0%, 20%, 50%).
      2. For each case:
         a. Attempts to generate a random map with a valid path 
            (using A* for validation).
         b. Runs A* and Dijkstra’s algorithm on the same grid.
         c. Records:
            - Grid statistics (total, obstacles, free cells).
            - The found path, path length, and node-wise (g, h, f) costs.
            - The total number of expanded nodes.
            - The order in which nodes were expanded (search frontier).
            - CPU runtime for each algorithm.
            - Visualizations of the map and expansion.
         d. Prints all results to the console and saves them to a .txt file.
         e. Saves visualization plots as .png image files.
      3. If no solvable grid can be generated within the allowed number of 
         attempts, records and reports the error.

    Parameters: None

    Returns: None

    Output/Side-effects:
        - Prints statistics, paths, costs, and expansion orders for A* and 
          Dijkstra to the terminal.
        - Writes all results for each test case to a text file named 
          "astar_dijkstra_case_{i}.txt".
        - Saves visualization images for each test case and algorithm as 
          "ad_astar_case_{i}.png" and "ad_dijkstra_case_{i}.png".

    Exceptions:
        - If a solvable map can't be generated for a given obstacle probability, 
          catches the error and records the failure for that test case.

    Notes:
        - The function is intended for use as a script entry point.
        - Designed for extensibility: easily adjust grid size, obstacle 
          probabilities, and algorithms.
        - All outputs are suitable for automated comparison of search algorithm 
          efficiency and behavior under varying map conditions.
